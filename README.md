# Sitting_Posture_Correction_MediaPipe
A MediaPipe based approach which detects wrong sitting postures based on angles between body landmarks.

This angle based approach was inspired by a TED-Ed video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyK0oE5rwFY). Its description reads as:
"Has anyone ever told you, “Stand up straight!” or scolded you for slouching at a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying—but they’re not wrong. Your posture is the foundation for every movement your body makes and can determine how well your body adapts to the stresses on it. Murat Dalkilinç gives the pros of good posture. "

These words ring very true. Here's an approach which can help you correct your posture. It recognizes bad sitting posture based on the angle between the landmarks detected by MediaPipe from videos and issues an alert when you're not sitting correctly. The details of the implementation are highlighted in the jupyter notebook attached.
